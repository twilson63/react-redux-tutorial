## Install Tachyons

Tachyons is a functional approach to css, instead of creating classes that contain a bunch of settings for different css attributes, you use small sub-atomic macros to compose a css style together. This will make it easy to produce css without having to switch to css files.

It is very easy to install:

Open the `index.html` file and add the following link in the head section of the html file.

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tachyons/4.7.4/tachyons.css" />
```
