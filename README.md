# React Tutorial (Build an Error Log App)

In this tutorial, we are going to build an Error Log Application. The error log application will be an app we can use to record the code errors we encounter and the solutions, so we can use it as a reference when we encounter the same error in the future. This application can be a great aid when you are getting started to help learn to troubleshoot issues, by breaking down the problem in little pieces.

If you have a github account, it would be a good idea to link it to your glitch account so you can commit to github after each step.

## Summary

The goal of this tutorial is not to make you a react, redux expert as much as it is a way to practice the usage of these concepts. If this is your first exposure to JavaScript, React, or Redux, this will be very hard and you will not know what you are typing for the most part, but if you can follow along and get it working it would be a good start. If you follow the Drefus model, the first step to learning something is to learn how to do tasks by just following instructions, then as you get confidence in following the instructions, veer from the preset path and try to explore different ways of doing the same thing, this will really start to help you understand these concepts. But for starters, don't worry about trying to understand everything as much as just follow along in the tutorial. If you get stuck or find an issue with a section, a typo or something that is just not explained very clear, please post an issue on the github repo - https://github.com/twilson63/react-redux-tutorial/issues
